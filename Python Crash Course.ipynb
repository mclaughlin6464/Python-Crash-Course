The thing is, python is very much *unlike* most other standard languages, in some subtle ways at least. This leads to otherwise skilled programmers writing very bad python code. Writing slick, clean python code is very easy, if you just know the basics. \n",

      "\n",
      "Python isn't like other languages like C or Java. Unlike C or C++ (and like Java) python is an interpreted language. This means that rather than bring the whole file down to 1's and 0's before running it, python calculates everything on the fly. This makes it versatile and trasportable. And unlike Java, C, and almost every other language, python was built from the ground up as object-based. Even your ints and bools are objects (but more on that later). \n",
      "\n",
      "If python is so atypical, you may ask, why has it risen to such prominence? Well:\n",
      "\n",
      " * Python has a small learning curve. It's so easy, even a physicist can understand it.\n",
      " * Python is super duper well documented. Don't underestimate how awesome that is.\n",
      " * It's powerful and versatile. It can be funcitonal, OOP, whatever your heart desires.\n",
      " * Python has *insane* third party support that's easy to use that really fills in the gaps in python's core. \n",
      " \n",
      "Ok fine. But certainly some of these unique attributes have drawbacks? They certainily do. Your next operating system won't be written in python, that's for sure. But for many applications, python's flaws have not held it back. take for example:\n",
      "\n",
      " * A big criticism of python is that it is slow. I believe that a good portion of the time, slow python code can be fixed with a smarter programmer, but these criticisms have some merit. In a lot of situations, a clever python solution will be slower than a brute-force C solution. However, If my python code took twice as long to run, but half as long to write, who's the real winner? A lot of science code only needs to be run a few times, and in many situations the performance gains aren't that noticeable. To this end, there is a lot of interesting work being done in JIT compiled offshoots of python (Julia <3).\n",
      " \n",
      " * Python must be distributed open source. Any python code you publish, anyone can read it and figure out what you did. For publishing the new version of iTunes, this would be bad. But for science applications, this is great; most journals request you submit open source code anyway. And for many companies, like Dropbox, it's run away from the user on serverside.\n",
      " \n",
      "Python is great. It isn't an end all be all, but I bet by the end of this guide it'll be your new favorite. Before moving to the next seciton, let's get the cliche out of the way. Type `print 'hello world'` below press Shift+Enter."

The problem is, this creates a copy in memory. `izip` is an iterator version, and is way better (and faster). a `cycle` is an iterator that starts back at the begining after reaching the end.
